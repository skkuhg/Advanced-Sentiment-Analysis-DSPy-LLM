### Basic Sentiment Analysis

```python
from advanced_sentiment_analysis import AdvancedSentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = AdvancedSentimentAnalyzer()

# Analyze a review
result = analyzer.analyze_review(
    "This product exceeded all my expectations! Amazing quality and fast shipping.",
    category="electronics"
)

print(f"Primary Sentiments: {result.primary_sentiments}")
print(f"Emotions: {result.emotions_detected}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence_score:.2f}")
```

### Automated Response Generation

```python
from advanced_sentiment_analysis import AutomatedResponseSystem

# Initialize response system
response_system = AutomatedResponseSystem()

# Process review with automated response
result = response_system.process_review_workflow(
    "The delivery was late and the package was damaged.",
    category="logistics"
)

print(f"Generated Response: {result['workflow_result']['response_generated']['response_text']}")
print(f"Action Taken: {result['workflow_result']['action_taken']}")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from advanced_sentiment_analysis import ProductionSentimentPlatform

# Initialize production platform
platform = ProductionSentimentPlatform()

# Process large dataset
reviews_data = [
    {'review_text': 'Great product!', 'product_category': 'electronics'},
    {'review_text': 'Poor service experience', 'product_category': 'support'},
    # ... more reviews
]

results = platform.batch_processor.process_large_dataset(
    data_source=reviews_data,
    batch_size=100,
    output_format='json',
    save_path='results.json'
)

print(f"Processed {results['processing_stats']['processed_items']} reviews")
print(f"Business Health Score: {results['aggregated_insights']['business_health_score']:.2f}")
```
